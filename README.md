# java-oop-project


 Outline: In this project, you are expected to write a program that calculates and keeps the tiredness of a rectangular
 field as a 2D int array (tirednessMap), given the information about which parts of the field has been planted in the
previous years.
In the first line, the horizontal size of the rectangular field (sizeX) and the vertical size of the rectangular field (sizeY)
will be given as int values. In the second line, a planting information will be given for each previous year as an
information block. The information block will start with the year information (currentYear), how many plantings have
been made during that year (plantingCount) and plant_id s of the plants that have been planted, respectively (all as int
values). In the following plantingCount lines, the planting coordinates of a specific plant will be given as 4 integer
tuples: startXCoord, startYCoord, endXCoord, and endYCoord representing this smaller rectangular area has been
planted in this year. The effect of a plant holds for one year.
